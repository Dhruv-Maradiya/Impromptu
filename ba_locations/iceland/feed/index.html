										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>One of the most famous multi-day mountain hike in the Alps!</h3>
<h4>Adventure in France, Italy, and Switzerland: explore these alpine cultures. Hike to Lac Blanc!</h4>
<p>Hiking the Mt. Blanc Range allows for you to be as close as possible to this legendary alpine giant without actually climbing it. Every day, you will enjoy so many new adventures as you explore the different sides, cultures, and landscapes of the range: first through France, and then Italy and finally Switzerland. The well-marked trails and circuits are used for both trade and communications that have been used since Antiquity. This is hands down one of the world’s best and most classic multi-day mountain hikes!</p>
