										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Trip Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Approaching legendary Kilimanjaro from the south-west, we take the popular Machame Route, with a total trip time of nine days, thus giving us even more acclimatization time and an even better chance of reaching the summit. Lush rainforest and Alpine moorland characterize the Machame Route, a trek which is challenging, make no mistake, despite the extra time given to acclimatize. You will have a private vehicle to take you to and from the mountain. Accommodation on the mountain on this ‘Basic’ category trip will be in tented camps – a true adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Trip Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reaching the summit! Experiencing that incomparable, ‘roof of the world’ feeling</li>
<li>A more relaxed pace than other routes, but longer in time and distance. But very challenging!</li>
<li>Stunning views as you ascend.</li>
<li>Discover Shira Plateau and Barranco.</li>
<li>Climb the Lava Tower.</li>
<li>Dedicated guides, porters and cooks – a great team to help you on your way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trip Style</strong><br />
Basic</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>One of the most famous multi-day mountain hike in the Alps!</h3>
<h4>Adventure in France, Italy, and Switzerland: explore these alpine cultures. Hike to Lac Blanc!</h4>
<p>Hiking the Mt. Blanc Range allows for you to be as close as possible to this legendary alpine giant without actually climbing it. Every day, you will enjoy so many new adventures as you explore the different sides, cultures, and landscapes of the range: first through France, and then Italy and finally Switzerland. The well-marked trails and circuits are used for both trade and communications that have been used since Antiquity. This is hands down one of the world’s best and most classic multi-day mountain hikes!</p>
